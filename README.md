- 👋 Hi, I’m @RobinEggCodes
- 👀 I’m interested in learning data science to open doors in a new field.
- After discovering that there were minimal opportunities with a BS in Chemistry, I reviewed what I enjoyed the most during my degree: analyzing data and drawing conclusions.
- This led me down the rabbit hole of data science as the field was introduced to me after I took a break from graduate school.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning SQL, R, Data Visualization, Data Cleaning, and basics of data analytics through Google Data Analytics Certificate on Coursera, Kaggle, StrataScratch,
- and YouTube.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ...
- 📫 How to reach me ...
